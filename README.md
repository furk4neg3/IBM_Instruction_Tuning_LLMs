# Instruction Tuning for Large Language Models  

This repository contains the implementation of instruction-based fine-tuning for large language models (LLMs), often referred to as Instruction GPT. The project demonstrates the process of creating and applying various templates to fine-tune LLMs for diverse tasks, such as summarization, question-answering, dialogue, and code generation.  

## Objectives  
By completing this lab, you will learn how to:  
- Understand and create templates for instruction-response tasks.  
- Format datasets for instruction tuning to enhance model training.  
- Apply Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) techniques for efficient fine-tuning.  
- Configure and utilize the `SFTTrainer` for supervised fine-tuning of instruction-following models.  

## Key Features  
- **Templates:** Examples of instruction-response, summarization, question-answering, dialogue, and more.  
- **Dataset Preparation:** Formatting datasets for structured training with large language models.  
- **Fine-Tuning Techniques:** Implementation of LoRA for parameter-efficient training.  
- **Hugging Face Tools:** Using the Hugging Face ecosystem for seamless fine-tuning and evaluation.  

## Results
The instruction-tuned model demonstrates improved task-specific performance, effectively handling various scenarios like summarization, question-answering, and code generation.
